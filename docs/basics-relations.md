title: Relations between Types

Before we start, lets setup 2 schemas..

```js
// People.js
import mongoose from 'mongoose';
import composeWithMongoose from 'graphql-compose-mongoose';

var PeopleSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  firstName: { type: String },
  lastName: { type: String },
  email: { type: String },
  jobId: {
    type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
  },
});

export const People = mongoose.model('People', PeopleSchema);
export const PeopleTC = composeWithMongoose(People);
```

```js
// Company.js
import mongoose from 'mongoose';
import composeWithMongoose from 'graphql-compose-mongoose';

var CompanySchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: { type: String },
  description: { type: String },
  employeeIds: [
    {
      type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
    },
  ],
});
export const Company = mongoose.model('Company', CompanySchema);
export const CompanyTC = composeWithMongoose(Company);
```

### Adding a single relation

Lets start of building a relation from the people to their jobs.

```js
// People.js

// ... after the `export const PeopleTC...`
PeopleTC.addRelation('job', {
  resolver: () => CompanyTC.getResolver('findById'),
  prepareArgs: {
    _id: source => source.jobId,
  },
  projection: { jobId: true },
});
```

Remember to add projection as we need to get the `jobId` in order to find the company in the database.

### Adding a multiple relation

Now we should get those companies some employees.

```js
// Company.js

// ... after the `export const CompanyTC...`
CompanyTC.addRelation('employees', {
  resolver: () => PeopleTC.getResolver('findByIds'),
  prepareArgs: {
    _ids: source => source.employeeIds || [],
  },
  projection: { employeeIds: true },
});
```

Remember to add projection as we need to get the `employeeIds` in order to find the company in the database.

### Filters

By default relations may have arguments, eg. `filter`, `limit`, `skip` and `sort`. if you want to disable arguments just set them to `null`. Or you may hide it from schema and set value by default to them (see `_id` and `limit`).

```js
PeopleTC.addRelation('job', {
  resolver: () => CompanyTC.getResolver('findById'),
  prepareArgs: {
    _id: source => source.jobId, // calculate _id value
    limit: 10, // set default value
    sort: null, // just remove arg from schema
  },
  projection: { jobId: true },
});
```

### Relation function

```js
addRelation(
    fieldName: string,
    opts: {
        resolver: () => Resolver,
        prepareArgs?: RelationArgsMapper,
        projection?: ProjectionType,
        description?: string,
        deprecationReason?: string,
    })
): TypeComposer
```
